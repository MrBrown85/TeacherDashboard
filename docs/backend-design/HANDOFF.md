# FullVision v2 — Rebuild Handoff

**Purpose:** single source of truth for multi-session, multi-context-window continuation of the v2 rebuild. Each Claude run reads this, does the next task, updates this file, stops. The user just re-runs the same prompt.

**Prompt to repeat in each new session** (cold start — no prior context):

```
You are continuing the FullVision v2 rebuild. This is a long-running multi-session effort coordinated through a handoff doc.

Read docs/backend-design/HANDOFF.md in full. It contains: ground truth, safety gates, what's done, and links to the active plan docs and conventions you must follow.

Then:
1. Pick the top-most unchecked task from the active plan docs listed under Remaining work.
2. Execute it within the Safety gates (stop and ask if you hit one).
3. When done, tick the box and append a line to the Activity log.
4. Stop and return control — do not batch into the next task.

Do not invent model/effort choices; I've already set them per the table at the top of the doc.
```

Shorter version if you want to save tokens on a warm context:

```
Read docs/backend-design/HANDOFF.md and continue.
```

**Recommended model + effort per phase** (don't use Opus 1M + Extra high by default — it burns weekly quota fast):

| Phase                              | Model                       | Effort  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| 1 (write-path RPCs — mechanical)   | Sonnet 4.6                  | Medium  |
| 2 (git hygiene — trivial)          | Haiku 4.5                   | Low     |
| 3 (minimal client port — per file) | Sonnet 4.6                  | High    |
| 4 (data.js rewrite — domain logic) | Opus 4.7 (standard, NOT 1M) | High    |
| Stuck / novel bug                  | Opus 4.7 + Extra high       | one-off |

Set via `/model` and `/effort` before each session. Standard 200k context is enough — HANDOFF is designed to keep each session small.

---

## Prime directive

You are continuing an ongoing rebuild. **Read this whole file before touching anything.** Then:

1. Pick the next unchecked item from the active plan docs listed under **Remaining work**.
2. Execute it autonomously, **respecting the Safety gates** (below).
3. When done, check the box (`[x]`), append a one-line entry to the **Activity log** at the bottom, commit any artifact updates alongside the migration/code change.
4. Stop (return to user) if:
   - you hit a Safety gate,
   - the next task is blocked by user input,
   - you discover a new correctness issue that reshapes the plan — record it in **Discovered gaps** and stop.

**Do NOT** batch multiple phases silently. One phase, then stop and let the user re-invoke. This keeps context-window growth bounded.

### Reading order for first-time context load

1. [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) — charter, hard rules.
2. This file.
3. [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) — every answered question, do not relitigate.
4. [erd.md](erd.md) — live schema (source of truth).
5. [write-paths.md](write-paths.md) — Pass B RPC specs (now implemented).
6. [read-paths.md](read-paths.md) — Pass D computations.
7. [auth-lifecycle.md](auth-lifecycle.md) — Pass C flows.
8. [schema.sql](schema.sql), [rls-policies.sql](rls-policies.sql), [read-paths.sql](read-paths.sql), [write-paths.sql](write-paths.sql) — what's deployed.

## Working mode (updated 2026-04-21)

`main` is the source of truth and has been pushed to `origin`. The old `rebuild-v2` / PR-75 / PR-76 / PR-79 branch choreography is historical only.

- Default to local commits first; **push only when the user explicitly asks**.
- Avoid reviving or targeting historical branches/PRs that were superseded by `main`.
- Netlify still auto-deploys on push, and production is currently quota-blocked (`usage_exceeded`), so do not push speculatively just to "keep things synced."
- Supabase migrations on `gradebook-prod` are still allowed when a task requires them and the Safety gates permit it.

## Safety gates (NEVER proceed without explicit user approval)

Stop and ask if the next step requires any of these:

- **Destructive SQL on `gradebook-prod`**: `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE without WHERE`, wiping schemas. One-time approvals do not extend; each new destruction needs its own "yes."
- **Git actions on the main FullVision repo that rewrite state**: tagging, force-push, reset --hard, discarding uncommitted work, `git add -A` when untracked files might be sensitive, committing to a branch the user didn't specify.
- **Creating paid Supabase resources** (new projects, upgraded tiers) — blocked absolutely.
- **DNS / SMTP / email sends / PR opens / Slack messages** — all user-executed only.
- **Modifying files across many directories of the main repo in one shot** — always do one narrow slice, verify, stop. User memory says "Verify UI in Demo Mode" for any UI change; Claude cannot do manual UI verification autonomously.

If the user said "yes" to one action in a past session, **do not** assume it extends. Re-confirm per action.

---

## Current state (updated 2026-04-22)

The rebuild/reconciliation work is complete and lives on `main`. The phase queue below is preserved as a historical record, not as the current execution driver.

### gradebook-prod (Supabase)

- **Schema + RLS + function surface:** all deployed. 39 tables, every one RLS-enabled with ≥1 policy; live functions use `search_path = public`.
- **Write-path RPCs:** every Pass B §1–§16 path is live. Write-paths.sql mirrors what's deployed.
- **Read-path RPCs:** live surface includes `list_teacher_courses`, `get_gradebook`, `get_student_profile`, `get_learning_map`, `get_class_dashboard`, `get_term_rating`, `get_observations`, `get_assessment_detail`, and `get_report` (+ computation helpers described in `read-paths.md` / `read-paths.sql`).
- **Retention cron:** `fv_retention_cleanup_daily` (pg_cron, 03:17 UTC) — purges 30-day-stale soft-deleted teachers + >2yr audit rows.
- **Advisors:** 0 security lints, 0 actionable performance lints.

### Main FullVision repo (branch `main`, pushed)

- **`shared/supabase.js`** — audited clean (auth-only).
- **`shared/data.js`** — boot path (`initAllCourses` / `_doInitData`) calls the v2 RPCs. `_canonicalCoursesToBlob`, `_v2GradebookToCache`, `_persistScoreToCanonical`, `_canonical{Enroll,UpdateStudent,UpdateEnrollment,Withdraw}`, `_canonicalCreate/Update/DeleteAssessment`, `_persistObservationCreate/Update/Delete` all routed to v2 RPCs. `_v2GradebookToCache` now hydrates category rows into `_cache.categories[cid]`, and assessment payloads round-trip `category_id`. Fresh first sign-in now detects an empty Welcome Class, applies the existing `shared/demo-seed.js` payload once, and queues a one-shot gradebook landing. Legacy per-course RPC fan-out is unreachable (retained for reference).
- **`shared/supabase.js` + `login-auth.js`** — account lifecycle is further along: `reauthenticateWithPassword(...)` now re-checks credentials for sensitive actions, sign-in runs the restore-account check before redirect, deleted teachers see the restore prompt with `Restore` / `Continue deletion`, and long-form surfaces now use the draft-safe session-expired path instead of losing work on the 30-minute idle timeout.
- **`window.v2.*` namespace** — 40+ thin RPC wrappers covering everything the backend exposes: course / category / module / rubric / subject / competency-group / section / tag CRUD + reorder; student + enrollment + roster + bulk pronouns + CSV import; assessment CRUD + collab; scoring (cell/tag/rubric/status/comment/fill/clear); observations + templates + custom tags; student-record writes + `getStudentProfile`; `saveTermRating`; ReportConfig + preferences + teacher-lifecycle; imports (CSV, Teams, JSON restore).
- **`shared/offline-queue.js`** — `window.v2Queue` FIFO + dead-letter + 3-attempt backoff + auto-flush, wired into `teacher/app.html` and `teacher-mobile/index.html`. It now also exposes `subscribe(...)` so desktop/mobile UI can react to queue/network changes without polling.
- **`scripts/dev-local.mjs` / `npm run dev:local`** — local signed-in dev flow now lives on `main`; no Netlify preview/build credits are needed for local verification.
- **`shared/calc.js`** — category-aware helpers now exist for the letter pipeline: `courseShowsLetterGrades`, `getAssessmentOverallScore`, `getCategoryAverage`, `qToPercentage`, `percentageToLetter`, and `getCourseLetterData`. Desktop/report surfaces can now derive letter + percentage from weighted categories instead of the old summative/formative split.
- **`teacher/dash-class-manager.js`** — Tier-A course-settings UI is live on `main`: 3-way `grading_system` segmented control, inline category management, saved-category gating for Letter/Both, Mean + Median calc methods, grading/calc descriptions, and late-work-policy editing.
- **`teacher/page-assignments.js`** — assessment create/edit/export flows are now category-aware: the legacy type toggle is replaced by a Category dropdown, filters are `All / Categorized / No Category`, and exported JSON/CSV include categories. The rubric editor also supports per-criterion weights and per-level value overrides, and `saveRubrics(...)` now dispatches canonical rubric writes through `window.v2.upsertRubric`, rehydrates canonical rubric/criterion ids from Supabase, and patches linked assessment `rubricId` values back onto the server-safe ids.
- **`teacher/page-gradebook.js` + desktop report/header surfaces** — gradebook filters, badges, and add-assessment popover now use categories; row/summary/report letter displays read `getCourseLetterData` so Letter/Both mode follows the category-weighted pipeline on desktop. Gradebook also carries the dismissible Welcome Class sample banner when the seeded course is active.
- **`teacher/ui.js` + `teacher/styles.css` + `teacher/router.js`** — desktop offline UX now ships: unsynced badge on the account avatar, sync-status popover (queue counts, last-sync time, dead-letter dismiss/retry), and the offline banner strip that pushes the dock down while offline. The old sync toast retry action now calls the real queue flush path.
- **`teacher/page-reports.js` + `teacher/page-observations.js` + `teacher/ui.js`** — the two long-form surfaces now register draft-preservation auth context. On term-rating narrative saves or observation capture writes, the v2 dispatch layer tries `refreshSession()` first; if refresh fails, a password modal keeps the draft visible, retries the failed write on success, and offers a copy-draft escape hatch on dismiss.
- **`teacher/ui.js`** — desktop account menu now uses a real Delete Account flow instead of the local-only “Clear This Device” affordance: exact 30-day grace copy, typed-email confirm, password re-entry, `window.v2.softDeleteTeacher()`, then sign-out.
- **Quality baseline** — `npm test` currently passes `834` tests with `1` skipped (run on 2026-04-22).
- **Playwright baseline** — `e2e/regression-smoke.spec.js` now covers the local auth/write/sign-out/sign-in/read round-trip with a durable fake backend harness in `e2e/helpers.js`; targeted verification is green for that smoke plus `e2e/auth.spec.js`, `e2e/gradebook.spec.js`, and `e2e/score-entry.spec.js` (`27` passing on 2026-04-22).
- **Feature flags** on `window`: `__V2_GRADEBOOK_READY` (default true), `__V2_WRITE_PATHS_READY` (false — legacy `gb-retry-queue` replay gated off until the bulk `_syncToSupabase` machinery is retired).
- **GitHub state:** no open app PRs are required for the rebuild; stale gap-fill PR #79 was closed as superseded by `main`.

### Remaining work

- The active next-work lists are now:
  - [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-21-ui-v1-feature-gap.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-04-21-ui-v1-feature-gap.md) — Tier A is shipped on `main`; remaining open UI work starts in Tier B.
  - [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-post-reconciliation-backlog.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-post-reconciliation-backlog.md)
- Highest-signal unresolved items today: Netlify quota / `fullvision.ca` 503 (`P1.0`), leaked publishable key cleanup (`P1.1`), data export backend gap (`T-UI-05` + `T-BE-01 export_my_data`), the remaining non-desktop category-migration cleanup (`P2.6`), and the course timezone UI gap (`T-UI-03`).
- The dormant legacy fan-out in `_doInitData` and the bulk `_syncToSupabase` block are now cleanup/backlog work, not blockers.

---

## Historical work queue

The queue below is complete and kept for archaeology. Do **not** treat it as the live next-task list anymore; use the backlog plans linked above instead.

Any references below to `rebuild-v2`, "local only," or "pending Demo-Mode verification" are historical checkpoint notes from before the merge/push.

### Phase 1 — Pass B write-path RPCs (server-side, deploy to gradebook-prod)

Author each RPC per [write-paths.md](write-paths.md), deploy as a new migration on `gradebook-prod`, update [write-paths.sql](write-paths.sql) (create this file in this worktree; it's the design-artifact mirror of what got deployed). After each RPC group, run a smoke test and check the box.

RPC inventory is grouped so each box is ~one session of work:

- [x] **1.1 Auth/bootstrap RPCs**: `bootstrap_teacher()` (creates Teacher + TeacherPreference + Welcome-Class seed per Pass C §1.3 + Q45/Q47), `soft_delete_teacher()` (Q29).
- [x] **1.2 Course CRUD RPCs**: `create_course`, `update_course`, `archive_course`, `duplicate_course` (structure-only per Q27), `delete_course`.
- [x] **1.3 Category + Module + Rubric RPCs**: `upsert_category` (per-course weight-cap enforced by trigger already deployed), `delete_category`, `upsert_module`, `delete_module`, `upsert_rubric` (full criteria payload), `delete_rubric`.
- [x] **1.4 Learning map RPCs**: `upsert_subject`, `delete_subject`, `upsert_competency_group`, `delete_competency_group`, `upsert_section`, `delete_section`, `upsert_tag`, `delete_tag`, `reorder_*` family.
- [x] **1.5 Student + Enrollment RPCs**: `create_student_and_enroll`, `update_student`, `update_enrollment`, `withdraw_enrollment`, `reorder_roster`, `bulk_apply_pronouns`, `import_roster_csv`.
- [x] **1.6 Assessment CRUD RPCs**: `create_assessment`, `update_assessment`, `duplicate_assessment`, `delete_assessment`, `save_assessment_tags` (AssessmentTag join).
- [x] **1.7 Scoring RPCs**: `upsert_score` (with ScoreAudit write in same tx per Q28), `upsert_rubric_score`, `upsert_tag_score`, `set_score_status`, `clear_score`, `clear_row_scores`, `clear_column_scores`, `save_score_comment`.
- [x] **1.8 Observation + Template RPCs**: `create_observation`, `update_observation`, `delete_observation`, `upsert_observation_template` (per Q4; seed `is_seed=true` are immutable), `delete_observation_template`.
- [x] **1.9 Student-record RPCs**: `upsert_note`, `delete_note`, `upsert_goal`, `upsert_reflection`, `upsert_section_override`, `clear_section_override`, `bulk_attendance`.
- [x] **1.10 Term rating RPCs**: `upsert_term_rating` (with TermRatingAudit writes per Q28), all join-table updates (strengths, growth, assessment mentions, observation mentions).
- [x] **1.11 ReportConfig + preferences RPCs**: `save_report_config`, `apply_report_preset`, `save_teacher_preferences`.
- [x] **1.12 Cleanup cron (pg_cron Edge Function)**: hard-delete teachers where `deleted_at < now() - interval '30 days'` (Q29), and purge audit rows older than 2 years (Q28).

### Phase 2 — Git hygiene on main repo (needs user OK per Safety gate)

- [x] **2.1** User chose "commit". Committed 27 files on `docs-cleanup-redundant-stale` as `e7f935c` ("Checkpoint: diagrams, inputs inventory, stale-docs cleanup"); added `.playwright-cli/` to .gitignore.
- [x] **2.2** Tagged `legacy-v1` at `main` (commit `c028ec9`, "Merge pull request #73 from MrBrown85/guard-initdata-rpc-calls"). Tag is local only — user pushes to origin when ready.
- [x] **2.3** Created branch `rebuild-v2` from `main` (same commit as `legacy-v1` tag). Local only; not yet pushed.

### Phase 3 — Minimal client port (main repo, one file at a time)

Each task here edits one file in `/Users/colinbrown/Documents/FullVision/`, then stops for the user to verify in Demo Mode. Do NOT batch.

- [x] **3.1** `shared/supabase.js` audited on branch `rebuild-v2`: no references to any dropped schema, no legacy RPC calls, no `.from('plural_name')` table calls. Pure auth + session + idle-timeout code; fully v2-compatible. No edits needed.
- [x] **3.2** Identified boot path as `initAllCourses()` in `shared/data.js` (previously called legacy `get_teacher_preferences` + `list_teacher_courses`). Replaced with v2 `bootstrap_teacher(email, display_name)` + new v2-shaped `list_teacher_courses()` RPC (migration `fullvision_v2_read_path_list_teacher_courses`). `_canonicalCoursesToBlob` remapped to v2 columns; policy fields now arrive with the list (lazy `get_course_policy` retired). Commits `a9cdb2b` + `e9f84ce` on `rebuild-v2`. **Pending user verification in Demo Mode.**
- [x] **3.3** Short-circuited `_doInitData()` behind `window.__V2_GRADEBOOK_READY` — populates empty-but-valid blobs for all 13 course-scoped fields so the app shell renders without calling any of the 12 dropped per-course legacy RPCs. Also gated the `gb-retry-queue` replay behind `window.__V2_WRITE_PATHS_READY` so stale queue entries don't spam errors against dropped tables. Commit `62e8406` on `rebuild-v2` (local only; no push). Demo Mode unaffected. **Pending user verification in Demo Mode + a signed-in v2 account.**
- [x] **3.4** Ported `_doInitData()` to call `get_gradebook(p_course_id)`; added `_v2GradebookToCache(cid, payload)` mapper that populates `_cache.students[cid]` (enrollment-id-keyed, app shape), `_cache.assessments[cid]` (v2 shape), and stashes the raw payload on `_cache.v2Gradebook[cid]` for later cell-rendering passes. Default-on via `window.__V2_GRADEBOOK_READY`. Legacy per-course fan-out in `_doInitData` now unreachable (left in place for reference until Phase 4 ports subsume each section). Smoke-tested against `gradebook-prod`: `get_gradebook` returns expected shape (1 student + 1 assessment + cell score = 3.5). Commit `1c5bfe9` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). **Pending Demo-Mode + signed-in v2 verification.**
- [x] **3.5** Ported `_persistScoreToCanonical` to dispatch over v2 RPCs: `upsert_tag_score` (non-rubric), `upsert_rubric_score` (has_rubric, tid treated as criterion_id), `save_score_comment`. Added `window.upsertCellScore(cid, enrollmentId, assessmentId, value)` → `upsert_score` (overall per-cell) and `window.setCellStatus(enrollmentId, assessmentId, status)` → `set_score_status`. Dispatch reads `has_rubric` from `_cache.v2Gradebook[cid].assessments[aid]` populated in 3.4. Commit `584c832` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). gradebook-prod smoke confirms all 5 RPCs land + rubric-assessment rejection works. **Pending Demo-Mode verification.**

### Phase 4 — Incremental data.js rewrite

Each task = one functional area (students, assessments, observations, term ratings, reports, learning map, preferences). Order by dependency. One per session, user-verify in Demo Mode after each.

- [x] **4.1** Students + enrollment CRUD. Ported `_canonicalEnrollStudent` (`create_student_and_enroll`, passes through existing personId), `_canonicalUpdateStudent` (`update_student` jsonb patch), `_canonicalUpdateEnrollment` (`update_enrollment` jsonb patch w/ designations + roster_position + is_flagged), `_canonicalWithdrawEnrollment` (`withdraw_enrollment`). Added `window.reorderRoster`, `window.bulkApplyPronouns`, `window.importRosterCsv`, `window.setEnrollmentFlag`. Commit `13b3403` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). gradebook-prod smoke: all 8 dispatch paths pass. **Pending Demo-Mode verification.**
- [x] **4.2** Assessment CRUD. Ported `_canonicalCreateAssessment` → `create_assessment`, `_canonicalUpdateAssessment` → `update_assessment` (jsonb patch + tag_ids replace), `_canonicalDeleteAssessment` → `delete_assessment`. Added `window.duplicateAssessment`, `window.saveAssessmentTags`, `window.saveCollab`. Commit `70d40b9` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). gradebook-prod smoke: 6/6 dispatch paths. **Pending Demo-Mode verification.**
- [x] **4.3** Score + rubric score + tag score entry. (3.5 landed upsertCellScore / upsertTagScore·RubricScore dispatch / setCellStatus / save_score_comment.) Added `window.fillRubric`, `window.clearScore`, `window.clearRowScores`, `window.clearColumnScores`. Legacy `sb.from('scores')` sync paths in `_syncToSupabase` are already short-circuited since the transition started. Commit `6cb58cf` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). **Pending Demo-Mode verification.**
- [x] **4.4** Observations + templates. Ported `_persistObservationCreate`/`Update`/`Delete` to `create_observation` / `update_observation` / `delete_observation` (v2). Quick-post sends single-element enrollment array; rich capture-bar path via new `window.createObservationRich` + `window.updateObservationRich` accepts multi-student + tag + custom-tag membership. Added `window.upsertObservationTemplate` / `window.deleteObservationTemplate` (seeds immutable) and `window.createCustomTag`. Commit `71ee3de` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). gradebook-prod smoke: create/update/delete + templates + custom tag all verified, FK cascade confirmed. Note: legacy `dims` field (text codes) is not passed as `tag_ids` — that lands with Phase 4.5 learning-map port.
- [x] **4.5** Learning map (subjects/groups/sections/tags/modules/rubrics). Exposed all 20 structural RPCs under `window.v2.*` namespace: `v2.upsert/delete/reorderSubjects`, `v2.upsert/delete/reorderCompetencyGroups`, `v2.upsert/delete/reorderSections`, `v2.upsert/delete/reorderTags`, `v2.upsert/delete/reorderModules`, `v2.upsert/deleteCategory`, `v2.upsert/deleteRubric` (rubric composite maps camelCase → snake_case criteria payload). Added `_rpcOrNoop` helper. Existing blob-based `saveLearningMap` / `saveCompetencyGroups` / legacy `deleteRubric` local functions unchanged — blob cache → v2 per-entity migration lands when the learning-map UI is rewritten. Commit `20c000f` on `rebuild-v2` (local only).
- [x] **4.6** Student profile view. Added `window.v2.getStudentProfile` (→ `get_student_profile`), `v2.addNote`/`deleteNote`, `v2.saveGoal`, `v2.saveReflection` (1..5 guard), `v2.saveSectionOverride`/`clearSectionOverride` (1..4 guard), `v2.bulkAttendance`. Existing blob-based save\* functions unchanged — UI rewrites will call these directly. Commit `85f17b4` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). gradebook-prod smoke passes.
- [x] **4.7** Term rating editor. Added `window.v2.saveTermRating(enrollmentId, term, payload)` wrapping `save_term_rating`. Accepts camelCase payload (narrativeHtml, workHabits/participationRating, socialTraits, dimensions [{sectionId, rating}], strength/growthTagIds, mentionAssessment/ObservationIds); translates to snake_case wire format; omitted keys leave fields/sets alone, empty [] wipes. Commit `6f83ae7` on `rebuild-v2` (local only).
- [x] **4.8** Report preview. Added `window.v2.applyReportPreset` (brief/standard/detailed), `v2.saveReportConfig` (full replace, defaults preset='custom'), `v2.toggleReportBlock` (auto-flips preset='custom'), `v2.saveTeacherPreferences` (jsonb patch), `v2.softDeleteTeacher` / `v2.restoreTeacher` (Pass C §5). Every v2 RPC deployed on gradebook-prod now has a `window.v2.*` entry. Commit `7897916` on `rebuild-v2` (local only).
- [x] **4.9** Import flows. Deployed migration `fullvision_v2_write_path_imports`: `import_teams_class(payload)` (§15.2 — course + students + enrollments + assessments; match by SN→email→name; no scores) and `import_json_restore(payload)` (§15.3 — FK-safe topological replay, teacher_id forced to auth.uid(), UPSERT idempotent, covers 20 entity sections). Added `window.v2.importRosterCsv` / `v2.importTeamsClass` / `v2.importJsonRestore`. Commit `15e7cf2` on `rebuild-v2` (local only). gradebook-prod smoke passes both imports + idempotent re-run.
- [x] **4.10** Offline write queue. New module `shared/offline-queue.js` implements offline-sync.md §Queue model + §Sync lifecycle: `fv-sync-queue-v1` + `fv-sync-dead-letter-v1` localStorage stores, FIFO drain on `online` event + 60s auto-flush, 3-attempt retry with 1s/5s/30s backoff, dead-letter on exhaustion (doesn't block the queue), 500-entry / 5 MB cap, self-healing on parse failure. Public surface: `window.v2Queue.enqueue/flush/stats/deadLetter/dismissDeadLetter/clear/callOrEnqueue`. Loaded in both `teacher/app.html` and `teacher-mobile/index.html` right after `data.js`. Existing `window.v2.*` helpers unchanged — opt-in via `v2Queue.callOrEnqueue`. Commit `d55a44c` on `rebuild-v2` (local only).

### Phase 5 — Polish

- [x] **5.2** Custom SMTP via `fullvision.ca` (Q6). **DNS is user-only.** Runbook: [`smtp-setup.md`](smtp-setup.md) — covers provider choice (Resend recommended over Postmark / AWS SES), full SPF / DKIM / DMARC record set including merge instructions, Supabase SMTP configuration, email-template wrapper, verification checklist, common gotchas, and rollback. User confirmed DNS + Supabase custom-SMTP setup and first end-to-end signup email pass on Gmail + Outlook with SPF + DKIM + DMARC.
- [x] **5.3** Smoke-test pack at `docs/backend-design/smoke-tests.sql` — 23 psql DO blocks covering every Phase 1 RPC + Phase 3.2 read + Phase 4.9 imports + Phase 5.4 reads + Phase 5.5 writes + key invariants (RLS isolation, audit diff semantics, FK cascade + SET NULL fix, weight-cap trigger, seed-template immutability, idempotent re-imports, relink merge, clear_data tenant isolation). Each block uses a nested `begin ... exception when others then … end` subtransaction with a sentinel `'ROLLBACK_SMOKE_OK'` so fixtures always roll back and the script exits clean under `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`. Runnable via `psql … -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f smoke-tests.sql`; sample GitHub Actions workflow + design notes in [smoke-tests.README.md](smoke-tests.README.md). pgTAP deferred (no extension dependency needed).

### Phase 5 gap-fill (added 2026-04-20 after design-plan audit)

- [x] **5.4 Read-path completion** — deployed §2.3 through §2.8 + backfilled `get_student_profile.competency_tree`. Mirrored in [`read-paths.sql`](read-paths.sql). Smoke-tests extended (blocks 15–21).
  - [x] 5.4.1 `get_learning_map(p_course_id)` — migration `fullvision_v2_read_path_get_learning_map`; full tree + per-tag class_avg + coverage_count
  - [x] 5.4.2 `get_class_dashboard(p_course_id)` — migration `fullvision_v2_read_path_get_class_dashboard`; class_avg + histograms + per-assessment/per-group averages + at-risk list + flagged count
  - [x] 5.4.3 `get_term_rating(p_enrollment_id, p_term)` — migration `fullvision_v2_read_path_get_term_rating`; prior state + course-scoped pickers + context numbers + suggested_dim_defaults
  - [x] 5.4.4 `get_observations(p_course_id, p_filters, p_page, p_page_size)` — migration `fullvision_v2_read_path_get_observations`; filtered + paginated + indexes
  - [x] 5.4.5 `get_assessment_detail(p_assessment_id)` — migration `fullvision_v2_read_path_get_assessment_detail`; metadata + rubric/criteria + linked tags + per-cell state
  - [x] 5.4.6 `get_report(p_enrollment_id, p_term?)` — migration `fullvision_v2_read_path_get_report`; block-by-block composition per ReportConfig
  - [x] 5.4.7 `get_student_profile.competency_tree` backfill — migration `fullvision_v2_get_student_profile_competency_tree`; the one TODO left in the original RPC
- [x] **5.5 Write-path completion** — deployed `delete_student` (§4.5), `relink_student` (§15.4, merge + move + ghost delete), `clear_data` (§16.2, tenant-isolated). Mirrored in [`write-paths.sql`](write-paths.sql). Smoke-tests extended (blocks 22–23). Migration: `fullvision_v2_write_path_student_delete_relink_clear`.

Client side: 9 new `window.v2.*` wrappers landed (`getLearningMap`, `getClassDashboard`, `getTermRating`, `getObservations`, `getAssessmentDetail`, `getReport`, `deleteStudent`, `relinkStudent`, `clearData`). **Every design-inventoried RPC now has a live implementation + client helper.**

## Discovered gaps (append as found)

When Claude finds a real defect mid-session that reshapes the plan, add a bullet here describing it and the remediation. Don't silently fix and continue.

Earlier bugs fixed inline (mostRecent ambiguity, decaying_avg ambiguity, missing GRANTs) are in the Activity log, not here.

- **2026-04-19 (Phase 1.4):** `section_competency_group_fk` used `ON DELETE SET NULL` without a column list, so deleting a `competency_group` tried to null `section.course_id` (NOT NULL). Fixed via migration `fullvision_v2_fix_section_competency_group_fk_set_null` using PG15+ `SET NULL (competency_group_id)`. schema.sql updated to match.
- **2026-04-19 (Phase 1.11):** `report_config.preset` CHECK was `in (brief,standard,detailed)` but write-paths §14 requires `'custom'` for manual block toggles. Fixed via migration `fullvision_v2_fix_report_config_add_custom_preset`; schema.sql updated.
- **2026-04-20 (plan reconciliation):** The `main`-branch client calls `sb.rpc('save_course_score', …)` at [`shared/data.js:2731`](../../shared/data.js:2731), but no such RPC exists on `gradebook-prod`. Every score save since PR #63 (2026-04-18) has `console.warn`-logged an error and lost the remote write; localStorage kept the UI looking correct. Hotfix: Phase 1 of [the reconciliation plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-database-wiring-reconciliation.md) — no-op the RPC call on `main` until `rebuild-v2` ships. Root cause: `ACTION_PLAN.md` was authored against a canonical-schema RPC naming scheme that the v2 rebuild replaced; the ACTION_PLAN was never reconciled after the rename. The claim "canonical-RPC migration ~70% complete" in `ACTION_PLAN.md` is in fact 0% — the one writer that was wired (`_persistScoreToCanonical`) targets a non-existent function. **Resolved 2026-04-20:** rebuild-v2 merged to main via --no-ff — v2 dispatch is now the active path.
- **2026-04-20 (Phase 2.2 diff):** Design SQL (`write-paths.sql` + `read-paths.sql`) is missing 17 functions that landed on `gradebook-prod` from 2026-04-19/20 but never got mirrored back per convention #6. Affected RPCs: read-path (`get_assessment_detail`, `get_class_dashboard`, `get_learning_map`, `get_observations`, `get_report`, `get_term_rating`), imports (`import_json_restore`, `import_teams_class`), term rating (`save_term_rating`), student (`delete_student`, `relink_student`), plus internal helpers (`fv_check_category_weight_sum` trigger, `fv_owns_*` RLS predicates, `clear_data`). Remediation: regenerate `write-paths.sql` and `read-paths.sql` from live DB as part of Phase 5.1 of the reconciliation plan. No functional impact — live RPCs work correctly; only the design-artifact mirrors are behind.
- **2026-04-20 (Phase 3.0 test baseline):** `tests/data-init-invokes-canonical-reads.test.js` and `tests/data-pagination.test.js` were guarding against the April 3 regression using the cancelled canonical-schema RPC names (`list_course_roster`, `list_course_assessments`, etc.). Both files were updated to guard against `get_gradebook` being stubbed (the actual v2 boot read); all 36 test files now green. Commit `570529c` on `rebuild-v2`.
- **2026-04-20 (Phase 3.1-l, pre-existing):** `tests/mobile-components.test.js` (`MComponents.dateGroupLabel`) and `tests/mobile-observe.test.js` use fixed fixture dates (April 2026) combined with `new Date()` to label as "Today"/"Yesterday"/"This Week"/"Earlier". 5 tests flake on UTC-midnight rollover. Not touched this session (last edit 4eb04a2). Fix: either freeze `Date.now` in the suite (vitest `vi.useFakeTimers`) or express fixtures relative to the current day. Out of scope for the reconciliation plan.
- **2026-04-20 (Phase 5.3 pre-check):** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §"Data-layer overview" table (~lines 190–210) still lists the pre-rebuild canonical-schema RPC names (`save_course_score`, `save_section_override`, `save_student_goals`, `save_student_reflection`, `save_learning_map`, `projection.add_student_flag`, `projection.remove_student_flag`, `bulk_save_course_scores`, `delete_course_score`, etc.) as the current write surface. None of these exist on `gradebook-prod`. Remediation: regenerate the table against live RPCs as part of Phase 5.2 of the reconciliation plan.

---

- **2026-04-22 (T-WIRE-01 audit):** Grep of `teacher/` + `teacher-mobile/` for legacy save\* / sb.rpc call sites found two categories of unmigrated UI actions:

  **A — Score writes that never reach Supabase** (`saveScores` instead of `upsertScore`):
  - `teacher/page-gradebook.js:1420` — inline cell-edit `commit()`. Score-mode (cycle-click) uses `upsertScore` (✓ dispatches v2); inline text edit uses `saveScores` (✗ local only). Fix: replace bulk `saveScores(cid, allScores)` with per-entry `upsertScore(cid, sid, aid, tid, val)` calls inside `commit()`.
  - `teacher/page-gradebook.js:1275` — "Clear cell" context menu calls `saveScores` without calling `window.clearScore(enrollmentId, assessmentId)`. Fix: add `window.clearScore` call.
  - `teacher/page-assignments.js:setScore (line 1035)` — called by `selectTagLevel` (tag-level click in sidebar). Uses `saveScores` only. Fix: use `upsertScore` instead.
  - `teacher/page-assignments.js:selectScore (line 1062)` — level-button click. Uses `saveScores` only. Fix: use `upsertScore` instead.
  - `teacher/page-assignments.js:1005` — "notSubmitted" status writes zero scores via `saveScores`. Fix: pair with `upsertScore` (value=0) calls.
  - `teacher/page-gradebook.js:setPointsScore` calls `saveScores` in points-mode "isPtsCol" entry. Fix: add `window.upsertCellScore(cid, enrollmentId, assessmentId, raw)` call alongside.
  - `teacher-mobile/tab-grade.js:257, 305` — mobile score entry. Fix: use `upsertScore`.
  - Undo callbacks (`page-gradebook.js:1510`, `page-assignments.js:1101/1146`) restore local state; borderline acceptable for v1 since undo is ephemeral.

  **B — Learning-map CRUD that never reaches Supabase** (`saveLearningMap` only, no `window.v2.*`):
  - `teacher/dash-class-manager.js` (~25 call sites: lines 153, 232, 261, 1208, 1599, 1623, 1782, 1795, 1803, 1810, 1843, 1856, 1861, 1879, 1887, 1894, 1904, 1920, 1950, 1967, 1977, 1987, 1996, 2005, 2012, 2038, 2055). Every subject / section / competency-group / tag / reorder mutation writes only to `saveLearningMap` (local). `window.v2.upsertSubject`, `deleteSubject`, `upsertSection`, etc. exist but are never called from the UI. Fix: add paired `window.v2.*` dispatch alongside each mutation in dash-class-manager. This is a larger task and should be a dedicated session (new task: **T-WIRE-02 — learning-map v2 dispatch**).

  **C — Import paths that bypass v2 RPCs** (local-only):
  - `teacher/teams-import.js:705` — Teams CSV import writes scores via `saveScores`; `window.v2.importTeamsClass` exists but is not called here. Fix: call `window.v2.importTeamsClass` instead of writing locally.
  - `teacher/page-assignments.js:1631–1638` — Legacy local JSON `importData()`. Calls save\* locally; should use `window.v2.importJsonRestore` for remote persistence. Lower priority (this is a "restore from file" escape hatch, not a primary path).

  **D — Acceptable local-only (no fix needed)**:
  - `teacher/page-assignments.js:853` — removes score rows from local cache after `delete_assessment`; DB cascade already cleaned remote. OK.
  - `teacher/ui.js:781` — cleans up local scores blob after `window.v2.deleteStudent`. OK.

  **Recommended follow-up sequence** (new tasks to add to TASKS.md):
  1. **T-WIRE-01a** — Fix score writes in `setScore` / `selectScore` / `commit()` / `setPointsScore` in page-assignments.js + page-gradebook.js + tab-grade.js. Replace `saveScores` with `upsertScore`; add `window.upsertCellScore` for points-mode overall cell. ~1 session.
  2. **T-WIRE-01b** — Fix "Clear cell" to call `window.clearScore`; fix Teams import to dispatch `window.v2.importTeamsClass`. ~30 min.
  3. **T-WIRE-02** — Learning-map CRUD v2 dispatch in dash-class-manager.js. ~2 sessions.

## Conventions Claude must follow

- **Never use `mcp__...__apply_migration` with `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, or anything that removes data** without an explicit per-action user approval.
- **All new DB objects go through `apply_migration`** (not `execute_sql`). Migration names start with `fullvision_v2_`.
- **Every new function must set `search_path = public`** (Supabase linter 0011).
- **Every new table gets RLS enabled + policy** in the same migration (linter guards).
- **Every new FK gets a covering index** unless it's the leading column of the PK (linter 0001).
- **Audit writes go inside the same transaction** as the parent write (Q28).
- **Test each new RPC with a DO-block smoke test** before checking its box. The smoke test must roll back its own seed (via sentinel exception at the end).
- **Update the matching design artifact** (`schema.sql` / `rls-policies.sql` / `read-paths.sql` / new `write-paths.sql`) in this worktree to mirror what's deployed.
- **No AI references in commits / branches / file comments** (user memory: `feedback_no_ai_references.md`). Do not add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or similar.
- **Match existing UI naming where the UI already expects it** (per folded-in rule in CLAUDE.md — the clean-room "ignore RPC names" rule was retired post-fold).

- `2026-04-19 | session-3 | 1.4 | deployed migration fullvision_v2_write_path_learning_map: upsert/delete for subject, competency_group, section (auto-denormalizes course_id from subject), tag; reorder_{subjects,competency_groups,sections,tags,modules}; smoke test passed (subject/group/section/tag CRUD, display_order auto-append, reorder, cascades, group-delete preserves section.course_id)`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | 0.1 | new docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-database-wiring-reconciliation.md — central 6-phase recipe; replaces ACTION_PLAN.md premise.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | 0.2 | ACTION_PLAN.md deprecated with banner pointing at reconciliation plan.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | 0.3 | discovered-gap bullet appended — save_course_score doesn't exist on prod, silent-failure since PR #63.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | 1 | hotfix: _persistScoreToCanonical now a no-op on main (colin/heuristic-leakey-b750e5 d7d234c); tests/data-persist-score-canonical-noop.test.js regression guard added; 658 vitest tests green; Demo-Mode verification pending user.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | 2.1 | schema.sql regenerated from gradebook-prod (root + docs/backend-design mirror); 39 tables + 95 RPC signatures documented; old 130KB migration-log content retired.`

- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | plan-3.1-a | HANDOFF 3.2 code review: initAllCourses() correctly calls bootstrap_teacher → list_teacher_courses; Demo Mode short-circuits before those calls; tests green; dev server running at http://localhost:8347; browser + signed-in verification pending user action`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | plan-3.1-a-verify | HANDOFF 3.2 fully verified end-to-end: signed in as brown_colin@surreyschools.ca → bootstrap_teacher created Teacher "Colin Brown" + Welcome Class on first v2 sign-in → list_teacher_courses returned it → Dashboard rendered with Welcome Class active (0 students — empty-state). DB confirms teacher row + 1 course. Local dev: required .env + substituted dist/ + npx serve (netlify dev --dir . bypasses edge function; netlify dev without --dir resolves publish-dir to git root, not worktree). Added dev:local script on rebuild-v2.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | plan-3.1-b-verify | HANDOFF 3.3 verified: __V2_WRITE_PATHS_READY gate (line 930) wipes stale gb-retry-queue; __V2_GRADEBOOK_READY gate (line 2051) short-circuits _doInitData with empty blobs. Demo Mode unaffected (_useSupabase=false at line 836 short-circuits before both gates). Empty-shell path exercised via signed-in Welcome Class rendering in 3.1-a. No code changes, tests green.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | plan-3.1-c-verify | HANDOFF 3.4 verified: get_gradebook(p_course_id) exercised in 3.1-a signed-in session for Welcome Class; _v2GradebookToCache mapped empty payload to empty cache correctly; Dashboard rendered empty-state. Shape-bridge logic covered by data-pagination.test.js (rewritten in 3.0). No code changes.`

- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | plan-3.1-n-verify | HANDOFF 4.10 verified: added tests/offline-queue.test.js (14 tests) covering enqueue, flush+dead-letter, stats, clear, callOrEnqueue (online/offline/network-error/validation/no-supabase). setTimeout faked to skip real backoff delays.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | plan-3.1-o-verify | HANDOFF 5.1 verified: added tests/demo-seed.test.js (10 tests) covering buildDemoSeedPayload Q43 counts + FK integrity + UUID shape + applyDemoSeed. Noted: categories live under \`\_categories_preview\` pending import_json_restore inclusion.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | plan-3.1-p-verify | HANDOFF 5.3 verified: smoke-tests.sql 14 DO blocks present; Block 14 (RLS cross-tenant isolation) re-verified live against gradebook-prod via MCP — all assertions pass, cross-tenant reads rejected.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | phase-3-verify-complete | all 16 rebuild-v2 phases (HANDOFF 3.2–3.5, 4.1–4.10, 5.1, 5.3) verified via 111 new unit tests + DB smoke + signed-in browser round-trip. rebuild-v2 ready for Phase 4 merge to main.`

Full suite 793 passing + 5 pre-existing date flakes (logged). Local only — push embargo remains.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | 4.3-action-plan | ACTION_PLAN.md already absent from main (deleted in earlier cleanup); no action required.`
- `2026-04-20 | session-5 | 5.3-sweep | Phase 5 doc sweep complete (commit 01112cb): 11 reference docs footered (8 backend-design + 3 root); docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Data-layer table regenerated with v2 RPCs; DECISIONS.md Q50 (save_course_score hotfix rationale) + Q51 (--no-ff merge choice) added. Re-sync grep found only historical comments in shared/data.js explaining retired RPCs — no live code or current-state claims reference dead canonical names.`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | 6.1-dead-code | removed ~230 LOC of dead legacy-bridge sync machinery from shared/data.js (commit 521500b): \_syncToSupabase / \_doSync / \_initRealtimeSync / \_refreshFromSupabase / \_handleCrossTabChange / \_deleteFromSupabase + retry-queue infrastructure (\_addToRetryQueue, \_retryFailedSyncs, retrySyncs, \_retryQueue, \_inflightSyncs, \_pendingWrites, \_syncKey, \_MAX_RETRIES, etc.) + all call sites. Added tests/data-dead-bridge-removed.test.js (7 TDD guards). Writes now route through v2 RPC dispatch; offline queue = window.v2Queue. Full suite 800 passing + 5 pre-existing date flakes.\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | 6.2-backlog | opened docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-post-reconciliation-backlog.md (11 items: P1 key rotation + Playwright e2e + push-embargo lift; P2 realtime re-publication + bulk read RPCs + delete_course semantics + SQL regen; P3 date-flake freeze + decisions.html regen + spec-vs-ui-diff replay; P4 demo-seed category promotion + Demo Mode migration to v2 generator).\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | 6.3-ship | moved docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-database-wiring-reconciliation.md → shipped/. Reconciliation plan complete.\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | push | local main (31 commits past origin/main) pushed clean — origin now at f76c666. Netlify auto-deploy triggered.\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | backlog-P3.1 | fixed 5 flaky date-sensitive mobile tests (commit 145686d): vi.setSystemTime freeze at 2026-04-20T12:00:00Z for dateGroupLabel describes + renders-multiple-date-groups test. 805/805 passing.\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | cleanup | removed throwaway worktrees .claude/worktrees/merge-test (was main) and .claude/worktrees/verify-rebuild-v2 (was rebuild-v2). main branch now checked out on primary repo path. Other pre-existing worktrees (heuristic-leakey + 4 older colin/\*) left intact.\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | backlog-P1.2 | added e2e/regression-smoke.spec.js skeleton (skipped pending P3.4 infra fix). Pre-probe of existing e2e suite found all 8 auth.spec.js tests failing — webServer serves raw source without credential substitution. New P3.4 backlog item tracks the fix.\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | backlog-P1.0 | DISCOVERED: fullvision.ca serving 503 "usage_exceeded" from Netlify post-push. Team Dev plan quota hit. Live site dark until user addresses billing. New P1.0 backlog item tracks the remediation options.\`
- \`2026-04-20 | session-5 | backlog-P3.4 | fixed Playwright webServer: new scripts/build-e2e.sh + npm run build:e2e + updated playwright.config.js to build dist with dummy credentials substituted then serve. Went from 0 passing → 123/141 e2e tests passing. Remaining 18 content-mismatch failures logged as P3.5 (not infra; test-vs-UI reconciliation).\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-6 | ui-spec-move | copied INSTRUCTIONS.md / DESIGN-SYSTEM.md / TASKS.md from fullvision-backend-design worktree into main's docs/backend-design/. They are now the authoritative spec on main. Opened docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-21-ui-v1-feature-gap.md tracking the four Tier-A UI tasks the user asked about (T-UI-02 grading system, T-UI-12 category creator, T-UI-09 rubric weight, T-UI-10 rubric per-level values) plus the remaining T-UI / T-OPS backlog.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-6 | T-UI-02 | A.1 grading_system segmented control shipped: 3 segments (Proficiency/Letter/Both, matches backend CHECK), letter+both gated on \_cmHasCategories with cm-seg-btn-disabled style + tooltip + hint, default by grade level, legacy summative/formative slider + Report-as-percentage + 'points' course-level value all retired. Fixed wizard step-2 picker, teams-import default, JSDoc, 2 test fixtures. 805/805 unit tests pass. Demo-Mode visual verification pending user.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-6 | T-UI-12 | A.2 Category management shipped inside Grading & Calculation: per-row (drag handle + name + weight % + delete), + Add button, running sum with >100 priority color, live warn + blur-commit, drag-reorder via window.v2.reorderCategories. New RPCs: list_categories + reorder_categories deployed as migration fullvision_v2_category_list_and_reorder (security-invoker, weight-cap trigger still enforces 100% server-side; live smoke passed). 2 new dispatch unit tests; 807/807 passing. Resolves T-UI-02 disabled-state naturally once first category is added.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-6 | T-UI-09 + T-UI-10 | A.3 + A.4 shipped together in teacher/page-assignments.js rubric editor: per-criterion Weight input (default 1) in header; per-criterion <details> disclosure 'Customize point values' with 4 inputs L4/L3/L2/L1 (default closed, opens when overrides present, reverting to default auto-removes override). addCriterion seeds the new fields. updateCritWeight + updateCritLevelValue handlers. CSS in assignments.css. Persistence caveat: saveRubrics still writes only to localStorage — new backlog item P2.5 tracks wiring to window.v2.upsertRubric for gradebook-prod persistence. 807/807 unit tests pass.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-6 | T-UI-12-fix | cmHasCategories now only counts SAVED rows (server id AND non-empty name) — transient '+ Add category' rows no longer flip Letter/Both enabled prematurely. Commit 3665af5.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-6 | calc-method-descriptions | added contextual 1-paragraph descriptions beneath the Calculation Method toggle (Phoneox port: grading-config.tsx:100-115). Commit 2293ada.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-6 | calc+grading+late-policy | three additions to Grading & Calculation panel (Q10 + Q19 + Phoneox port): Mean + Median calc methods (shared/calc.js \_calcGroup 'average' and 'median' branches; internal value 'average' matches backend CHECK, label reads 'Mean'); contextual grading-system descriptions for proficiency/letter/both; Late Work Policy textarea persisting through existing course.lateWorkPolicy → update_course RPC with null-on-empty coercion. +8 calc-pure unit tests. 815/815 passing. Commit df7d131.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-7 | main-consolidation | consolidated remaining useful branch-only work onto main, removed stale FullVision worktrees/branches, closed superseded PR #79, and confirmed main is the only active app branch.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-7 | e2e-gradebook-reports | fixed approved gradebook + reports e2e mismatches (seedScores normalization + report-tab selectors) and re-ran targeted Playwright slice: 17 gradebook/reports tests + 1 score-entry helper test passing.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-7 | handoff-refresh | removed stale pre-push / rebuild-v2 operational guidance from HANDOFF; current next work now lives in the backlog plans, not this completed phase queue.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-7 | docs-sweep | refreshed CLAUDE.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, TASKS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, backlog P2.4, and regenerated fullvision-documentation-inventory.xlsx to remove stale rebuild-v2 / missing-file / inventory references. decisions.html + spec-vs-ui-diff remain separate follow-up docs.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-8 | docs-sync | refreshed HANDOFF live guidance to point at the real active plans, recorded Tier-A UI completion + current 815-pass unit baseline in Current state, and reconciled TASKS.md so shipped work (T-UI-02 / T-UI-12 / T-UI-09 / T-UI-10 / T-OPS-01) is marked done while open work now starts at the remaining Tier-B/UI backlog.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-9 | category-doc-sync | reconciled HANDOFF/TASKS/backlog/gap-plan with the current local category slice: desktop assignments + gradebook + report/header letter surfaces now use category-aware paths, Welcome Class auto-seed is marked back to open because bootstrap still lands an empty course, and new backlog item P2.6 tracks remaining type-based dashboard/student/report-history/mobile cleanup. Tests remain 815 passed + 1 skipped.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-10 | welcome-auth-lifecycle | Welcome Class now auto-seeds on fresh bootstrap, lands once in gradebook, and shows a dismissible sample-class banner; term-rating auto-generate is hidden; sign-in now prompts restore when deleted_at is set; desktop Delete Account now uses exact 30-day grace copy + typed email + password reauth + soft-delete. Added 10 focused tests across welcome-class, report-questionnaire, login restore, and delete-account paths. Full suite 825 passed + 1 skipped.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-11 | offline-desktop-ux | desktop offline UX shipped: shared/offline-queue.js now exposes subscribe(...); teacher/ui.js + teacher/styles.css + teacher/router.js render an amber offline banner, unsynced avatar badge, and sync-status popover with queue counts, relative last-sync time, retry, and dead-letter dismiss. Added tests/offline-queue.test.js subscription coverage + tests/ui-sync-status.test.js. Full suite 829 passed + 1 skipped.\`
- \`2026-04-21 | session-12 | session-expired-longform | long-form session-expiry UX shipped: shared/data.js now guards v2 RPCs with silent refresh + modal fallback, teacher/page-reports.js and teacher/page-observations.js register draft-preservation context, shared/supabase.js marks long-form idle expiry instead of hard sign-out, and teacher/ui.js renders the password re-auth modal + copy-draft escape hatch. Added tests/data-session-expired-guard.test.js. Full suite 832 passed + 1 skipped.\`
- \`2026-04-22 | session-13 | backlog-P2.5 | rubric canonical persistence shipped: shared/data.js now syncs saveRubrics/deleteRubric through window.v2.upsertRubric/deleteRubric, rehydrates canonical rubric + criterion ids from rubric/criterion/criterion_tag, and patches linked assessment rubricIds; teacher/page-assignments.js now follows the canonical id when auto-selecting a newly saved rubric. Added tests/data-rubrics-v2-sync.test.js. Full suite 834 passed + 1 skipped. Demo-Mode verification still pending user.\`
- \`2026-04-22 | session-14 | backlog-P1.2 | Playwright auth round-trip smoke shipped at e2e/regression-smoke.spec.js using a durable fake-auth harness in e2e/helpers.js (local sign-up -> sign-in -> Welcome Class gradebook -> score write -> sign-out -> sign-in -> same score visible). Targeted Playwright verification: regression smoke + auth + gradebook + score-entry = 27 passing. Unit suite remains 834 passed + 1 skipped.\`

- `2026-04-22 | session-15 | T-WIRE-01 | audit complete — see Discovered gaps below for the full inventory. No code changes in this session; follow-up patches queued.`
- `2026-04-22 | session-16 | T-WIRE-01a | score-entry paths wired to upsertScore: selectScore + setScore in page-assignments.js, notSubmitted zero-writes, commit() in page-gradebook.js, setPointsScore in data.js (+ unit test), and setScore in tab-grade.js. Mobile test mocks updated to shared-store pattern. 837 passed + 1 skipped.`
