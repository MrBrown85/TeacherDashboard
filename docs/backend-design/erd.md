## Entity Dictionary

| # | Entity | Purpose | Key Attributes | Owning Actor | Cardinality Notes |
|---|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Teacher** | The authenticated user (teacher account). | id, email, display_name | System (auth) | Root entity. One per account. |
| 2 | **TeacherPreference** | Per-teacher settings: active course, view modes, widget layout. | teacher_id (PK/FK), active_course_id, view_mode, mobile_view_mode, mobile_sort_mode, card_widget_config | Teacher | 1:1 with Teacher. |
| 3 | **Course** | A class the teacher manages. Includes grading policy (system, calc method, decay, timezone, late-work policy). | id, teacher_id, name, grade_level, description, color, is_archived, grading_system, calc_method, decay_weight, timezone, late_work_policy | Teacher | Many per Teacher. Central hub. `grading_system` is `'proficiency' \| 'letter' \| 'both'`. When `letter` or `both`, Categories drive the percentage pipeline (Pass D §1.4). `late_work_policy` is free text — display only, not enforced by calc. Q→R% and R→letter cutoffs are hardcoded app-wide (BC standard). |
| 3a | **Category** | Teacher-named assessment grouping with a percentage weight — drives the letter/percentage pipeline. | id, course_id, name, weight, display_order | Teacher | Many per Course. Optional (a course may have zero). Weights UI-capped so the sum cannot exceed 100; sums < 100 are renormalized at read time. When `grading_system ∈ {letter, both}` the UI blocks selecting that mode without ≥1 Category. |
| 4 | **Student** | A student record. Can appear in multiple courses via Enrollment. | id, teacher_id, first_name, last_name, preferred_name, pronouns, student_number, email, date_of_birth | Teacher | Many per Teacher. Shared across courses. |
| 5 | **Enrollment** | Joins a Student to a Course. Carries per-course student state. | id, student_id, course_id, designations (`text[]`), roster_position, is_flagged, withdrawn_at | Teacher | Many per Course, many per Student. UNIQUE(student_id, course_id). `withdrawn_at` is nullable -- null means active. |
| 6 | **Subject** | A top-level subject in the learning map (e.g. "Reading", "Math"). | id, course_id, name, display_order | Teacher | Many per Course. display_order scoped within course. |
| 7 | **CompetencyGroup** | A named color-coded grouping of sections in the learning map. | id, course_id, name, color, display_order | Teacher | Many per Course. Optional grouping. display_order scoped within course. |
| 8 | **Section** | A learning standard / competency within a subject. | id, course_id *(denormalized)*, subject_id, competency_group_id, name, display_order | Teacher | Many per Subject. Optionally in a CompetencyGroup. display_order scoped within subject. `course_id` is denormalized from Subject for query convenience and FK validation -- invariant: must match `subject.course_id`. |
| 9 | **Tag** | A specific indicator / "I can" statement within a section. | id, section_id, code, label, i_can_text, display_order | Teacher | Many per Section. Leaf of the learning map tree. display_order scoped within section. |
| 10 | **Module** | An organizational unit for assessments (like a unit or chapter). | id, course_id, name, color, display_order | Teacher | Many per Course. display_order scoped within course. |
| 11 | **Rubric** | A reusable scoring rubric template. | id, course_id, name | Teacher | Many per Course. |
| 12 | **Criterion** | A single row in a rubric with 4-level descriptors, per-level point values, and a criterion weight. | id, rubric_id, name, level_{1..4}_descriptor, level_{1..4}_value, weight, display_order | Teacher | Many per Rubric. display_order scoped within rubric. `level_N_value` defaults to N (teacher can override). `weight` defaults to 1.0; normalized across the rubric at read time. |
| 13 | **CriterionTag** | Links a Criterion to Tags (standards the criterion assesses). | criterion_id, tag_id | -- | Join table. Many-to-many. |
| 14 | **Assessment** | An assignment, test, or task students are scored on. | id, course_id, category_id, title, description, date_assigned, due_date, score_mode, max_points, weight, evidence_type, rubric_id, module_id, collab_mode, collab_config | Teacher | Many per Course. `category_id` is nullable; when present, participates in the percentage pipeline. `type` (summative/formative) was removed in favour of `category_id`. display_order scoped within module (or within course for unmoduled assessments). `collab_config` is jsonb storing group assignments and exclusions atomically -- see design note below. |
| 15 | **AssessmentTag** | Links an Assessment to Tags (standards it covers). | assessment_id, tag_id | -- | Join table. Many-to-many. |
| 16 | **Score** | A student's overall score on an assessment, including assignment status. | id, enrollment_id, assessment_id, value *(nullable)*, status *(nullable: NS/EXC/LATE)*, comment | Teacher | One per Enrollment x Assessment. UNIQUE(enrollment_id, assessment_id). A row can have value only, status only, or both. Replaces the former separate AssignmentStatus entity. |
| 17 | **RubricScore** | Per-criterion score when an assessment uses a rubric. Sibling of Score, not child. | id, enrollment_id, assessment_id, criterion_id, value | Teacher | UNIQUE(enrollment_id, assessment_id, criterion_id). Exists independently of Score -- criterion-level entry comes first, overall Score.value can be derived or separately entered. |
| 18 | **TagScore** | Per-tag (standard) score on a non-rubric assessment. | id, enrollment_id, assessment_id, tag_id, value | Teacher | UNIQUE(enrollment_id, assessment_id, tag_id). **Only used for non-rubric assessments.** For rubric assessments, tag-level scores are derived at read time from RubricScore + CriterionTag -- not stored in TagScore. See design note below. |
| 19 | **Observation** | A qualitative teacher observation about student(s). | id, course_id, body, sentiment, context_type, assessment_id | Teacher | Many per Course. Links to students and tags via join tables. |
| 20 | **ObservationStudent** | Links an Observation to the student(s) it concerns. | observation_id, enrollment_id | -- | Join table. Many-to-many. |
| 21 | **ObservationTag** | Links an Observation to dimension/standard Tags. | observation_id, tag_id | -- | Join table. Many-to-many. |
| 22 | **ObservationCustomTag** | Links an Observation to teacher-defined CustomTags. | observation_id, custom_tag_id | -- | Join table. Many-to-many. |
| 23 | **ObservationTemplate** | A reusable template for quick-posting observations (mobile row 159). | id, course_id, body, default_sentiment, default_context_type, display_order | Teacher | Many per Course. Provides pre-filled text and defaults; the posted observation is a normal Observation row. |
| 24 | **CustomTag** | A free-form tag created by the teacher for observations. | id, course_id, label | Teacher | Many per Course. Permanently distinct from learning-map Tags. |
| 25 | **Note** | A free-text note attached to a student in a course. Immutable (add/delete only, no edit). | id, enrollment_id, body, created_at | Teacher | Many per Enrollment. |
| 26 | **Goal** | A goal set for a student on a specific learning section. | id, enrollment_id, section_id, body | Teacher | One per Enrollment x Section. UNIQUE(enrollment_id, section_id). |
| 27 | **Reflection** | A teacher reflection on a student for a section, with confidence rating. | id, enrollment_id, section_id, body, confidence | Teacher | One per Enrollment x Section. UNIQUE(enrollment_id, section_id). |
| 28 | **SectionOverride** | Manual override of a student's computed level for a section. | id, enrollment_id, section_id, level, reason | Teacher | One per Enrollment x Section. UNIQUE(enrollment_id, section_id). |
| 29 | **Attendance** | A daily attendance record for a student in a course. | id, enrollment_id, attendance_date, status | Teacher | UNIQUE(enrollment_id, attendance_date). |
| 30 | **TermRating** | Per-student per-term narrative and holistic ratings for report cards. | id, enrollment_id, term, narrative_html, work_habits_rating, participation_rating, social_traits (`text[]`) | Teacher | UNIQUE(enrollment_id, term). `social_traits` is a text array of selected trait names from a fixed app-defined set. |
| 31 | **TermRatingDimension** | Per-section competency rating within a term rating. | id, term_rating_id, section_id, rating | Teacher | Many per TermRating. UNIQUE(term_rating_id, section_id). |
| 32 | **TermRatingStrength** | Tags identified as strengths in a term rating. | term_rating_id, tag_id | -- | Join table. |
| 33 | **TermRatingGrowthArea** | Tags identified as growth areas in a term rating. | term_rating_id, tag_id | -- | Join table. |
| 34 | **TermRatingAssessment** | Assessments mentioned/highlighted in a term rating narrative. | term_rating_id, assessment_id | -- | Join table. |
| 35 | **TermRatingObservation** | Observations mentioned/highlighted in a term rating narrative. | term_rating_id, observation_id | -- | Join table. |

## Design Notes

### Collaboration storage (collab_config)

Assessment collaboration (groups, pairs, exclusions) is stored as a single `collab_config jsonb` column on Assessment rather than in normalized tables. Rationale:

- The entire group layout is written atomically (random pairs, random groups, manual assignment, drag reorder all replace the full config).
- There is no cross-assessment query need ("all groups student X has been in").
- The data is only read back in the context of a single assessment's collab panel.

Schema for `collab_config`:
```json
{
  "excluded_enrollment_ids": ["uuid", "..."],
  "groups": [
    {
      "group_number": 1,
      "enrollment_ids": ["uuid", "..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

When `collab_mode` is `"none"`, `collab_config` is null.

### TagScore vs RubricScore scope rule

These two entities handle different scoring flows and never overlap for the same assessment:

- **Rubric assessments** (assessment.rubric_id is not null): Teacher scores per-criterion via RubricScore. Tag-level scores are *derived at read time* by joining RubricScore → Criterion → CriterionTag. No rows are written to TagScore.
- **Non-rubric assessments** (assessment.rubric_id is null): Teacher scores per-tag directly via TagScore. RubricScore has no rows.

This avoids the ambiguity of two conflicting sources for the same tag-level score.

### Section.course_id denormalization + composite FK enforcement

Section carries `course_id` even though it's derivable from `subject.course_id`. This is intentional:

- Enables direct joins from course-scoped queries without chaining through Subject.
- Allows **database-level composite FK** constraints ensuring a Section only references Subjects and CompetencyGroups within its own course.

**Enforcement: composite foreign keys, not triggers.** Add `UNIQUE(id, course_id)` to Subject and CompetencyGroup. Then Section declares:

```sql
-- Subject and CompetencyGroup each get a composite uniqueness guarantee
ALTER TABLE Subject         ADD CONSTRAINT subject_id_course_uk         UNIQUE (id, course_id);
ALTER TABLE CompetencyGroup ADD CONSTRAINT competency_group_id_course_uk UNIQUE (id, course_id);

-- Section references them as composite FKs
ALTER TABLE Section
    ADD CONSTRAINT section_subject_fk
        FOREIGN KEY (subject_id, course_id)
        REFERENCES Subject(id, course_id);

ALTER TABLE Section
    ADD CONSTRAINT section_competency_group_fk
        FOREIGN KEY (competency_group_id, course_id)
        REFERENCES CompetencyGroup(id, course_id)
        MATCH SIMPLE;   -- competency_group_id is nullable; null skips the check
```

Postgres rejects at write time any Section row whose `course_id` doesn't match its referenced Subject / CompetencyGroup. No trigger, no application-layer check, no silent drift — the planner enforces it.

### Late-work policy is display-only

`Course.late_work_policy` is a free-text field that appears on report cards and student-profile headers. The backend does **not** parse, apply, or enforce it. Score rows with `status='LATE'` are informational (per Pass D §1.8) — no deduction is applied. If teachers later want automated late penalties, that's a separate entity (`LatePenaltyRule`) and a new calc-method branch.

### Soft-delete consideration

Assessment and Student are high-value entities where accidental deletion is catastrophic (cascades to scores, observations, etc.). This ERD does not prescribe a soft-delete mechanism, but implementers should consider one of:

- `deleted_at timestamp` column (soft delete, filter in queries)
- Audit log table capturing deletes with payload
- Point-in-time backup strategy

This is an implementation concern for Pass B/C.

## Changes from v2 — Pass D amendment folded in (2026-04-19)

The former `erd-amendment-pass-d.md` has been merged into this document. Its contents are now canonical here. Summary of what changed:

1. **Added `Category` entity** (row 3a) — teacher-named assessment grouping with a percentage weight. Drives the letter/percentage pipeline.
2. **Added `Assessment.category_id`** (FK to Category, nullable). Replaces the old `Assessment.type` (summative/formative).
3. **Dropped `Assessment.type`** — replaced by `category_id`.
4. **Expanded `Course.grading_system` enum** to `'proficiency' | 'letter' | 'both'`.
5. **Added `Course.timezone`** (IANA string; defaults to browser TZ on create; per Q22).
6. **Expanded `Course.calc_method` enum** to include `'average'` and `'median'` alongside the original four options.
7. **Dropped `Course.grading_scale`, `category_weights_enabled`, `summative_weight_pct`, `report_as_percentage`** — Q→R% and R→letter cutoffs are hardcoded app-wide (BC standard); category mechanics replace the old summative-weight slider.
8. **Added `Criterion.level_{1..4}_value`** (defaults 1/2/3/4; teacher-adjustable) and `Criterion.weight` (default 1.0; normalized across rubric at read time).
9. **Clarified `Score.status` values** as `'NS' | 'EXC' | 'LATE' | null` (matches existing UI; no rename).
10. **Added composite FK enforcement** for `Section.(subject_id, course_id)` and `Section.(competency_group_id, course_id)` — see Design Notes.
11. **Documented `late_work_policy` as display-only** in Design Notes and on the Course entity itself.

## Changes from v1

Summary of revisions applied during review:

1. **Merged CoursePolicy into Course.** Was 1:1, always co-fetched, never independently referenced. Nine policy columns now live on Course directly.
2. **Merged AssignmentStatus into Score.** Added nullable `status` field to Score. Eliminates a redundant intersection table and halves gradebook joins.
3. **Detached RubricScore from Score.** RubricScore now keys on `(enrollment_id, assessment_id, criterion_id)` instead of `score_id`. Criterion-level entry can precede the rollup Score.
4. **Collapsed collab entities into `collab_config jsonb`.** CollabGroup, CollabGroupMember, AssessmentExclusion replaced by a single JSON column on Assessment. Written atomically, no cross-assessment queries needed.
5. **Added `updated_at`** to all mutable entities: Student, Enrollment, Course, Assessment, Subject, Section, Tag, CompetencyGroup, Module, Rubric, Criterion, Attendance, ReportConfig, RubricScore, TagScore, ObservationTemplate.
6. **Added `created_at`** to entities that were missing it: Subject, CompetencyGroup, Module, Rubric, Criterion, CustomTag, Tag.
7. **`is_withdrawn` → `withdrawn_at timestamp`.** Preserves withdrawal date; null = active.
8. **`designations jsonb` → `text[]`.** Simpler, more queryable for a small fixed set (IEP, MOD, etc.).
9. **`social_traits jsonb` → `text[]`** on TermRating. Same rationale.
10. **Added ObservationTemplate entity.** Covers row 159 (mobile template quick-post).
11. **Documented `display_order` scopes** in entity dictionary for every entity that has one.
12. **Documented Section.course_id** as intentional denormalization with invariant.
13. **Documented TagScore vs RubricScore scope rule.** TagScore is non-rubric assessments only; rubric assessments derive tag scores from RubricScore + CriterionTag at read time.
14. **Flagged soft-delete** as an implementation concern for Assessment and Student.

## Open Questions

> **Status (2026-04-19):** all 7 questions below were answered during the decisions questionnaire. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) Tier 1 (Q4) and the "Pass A surviving open questions" section (Q38–Q42). Left here verbatim as a record of what was asked.

1. **Demo Mode entity status.** Row 17 records a "demo mode" toggle. Demo mode appears to be a session-level flag that seeds fake data and prevents real writes. It is not a persisted entity in the domain sense. Should we model a `demo_session` flag on Teacher, or treat it as purely an auth/session concern handled in Pass C?

2. **Attendance scope.** Rows 76-77 show bulk attendance date + status, but the notes say "no attendance RPC" -- attendance was never wired to the backend. The inputs clearly represent real data. This ERD includes an Attendance entity. Confirm this is wanted.

3. **CustomTag vs Tag reuse.** Custom tags (row 229) are free-form text on observations, separate from structured learning-map Tags. Should custom tags eventually be promotable to real Tags, or are they permanently distinct? Current design treats them as permanently distinct.

4. **Term rating `term` identifier.** Rows reference "Report 1-6." Is `term` always an integer 1-6, or could it be a named period? This affects whether `term` is an int or FK to a TermDefinition entity.

5. **Rubric scope.** Currently course-scoped. If teachers want to reuse rubrics across courses, the FK should lift to teacher_id. Which scope is correct?

6. **Student ownership model.** Students are owned by teacher (`teacher_id` FK). If a student appears in another teacher's courses, they'd need a separate Student record. Is this the intended model, or should Student be independent with Enrollment carrying the full relationship?

7. **ObservationTemplate creation.** Row 159 shows quick-posting from templates but no rows show template *creation or editing*. Are templates app-provided (seed data), or teacher-created through a UI that wasn't inventoried?
