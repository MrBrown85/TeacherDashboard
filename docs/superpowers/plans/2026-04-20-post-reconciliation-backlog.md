## P1 — operational / security (do first)

### P1.0 · Netlify site is serving 503 "usage_exceeded" — quota hit

- [ ] **User-only, urgent.** 2026-04-20 post-push probe returned `{"error":"usage_exceeded","message":"Usage exceeded"}` from `https://fullvision.ca/`. Site is on the **Team Dev** plan (`nf_team_dev`); monthly bandwidth / build minutes / edge-function invocations are capped.
- Check Netlify dashboard → Billing → see which quota is exhausted.
- Options: (a) wait for the month to roll over (if the cap is soft/monthly), (b) upgrade to Pro/Business, (c) reduce edge-function invocations (the `inject-env` function runs per HTML request — consider caching or pre-substituting at build time).
- While 503ing, the post-reconciliation push (commit `f76c666` and onwards) cannot be verified on production. Local `npm test` + `dev:local` flow still works end-to-end.

### P1.1 · Rotate the leaked publishable key `sb_publishable__CxM2aY7iVOxRid2EMtCiw_jT1g_n96`

- [ ] **User-only** (requires Supabase dashboard access).
- The key's name is "default" and it was committed in an earlier session's `.env.example` / screenshot flow.
- Replace all references in Netlify env vars + any `.env` files with the newer `prod202604` key (`sb_publishable_FfgtpNV7PStzUvYVD7qWOg_aAVjGrTY`).
- Disable the old key in the Supabase dashboard once the rotation is verified.

### P1.2 · Playwright end-to-end smoke: sign-up → write → sign-out → sign-in → read

- [ ] Covers the full auth+persistence round-trip the unit tests can't reach.
- Suggested flow: new account sign-up → email verification → Welcome Class appears → enter a score → sign out → sign back in → confirm the score survives.
- Lives at `tests/e2e/regression-core.spec.ts` (new).
- Runs locally via `npm run test:e2e` and in CI behind a nightly trigger (per-PR is overkill given the ~90s runtime).

### P1.3 · Lift the push embargo on `main`

- [ ] **User-only** — local `main` is 29 commits ahead of `origin/main` at the close of the reconciliation session.
- Decision: push as-is vs. open a single consolidation PR vs. squash the long-tail commits.
- After push, schedule a Demo-Mode smoke on the production Netlify deploy.

## P2 — schema & data platform

### P2.1 · Re-establish realtime publication for the v2 schema

- [ ] When `_initRealtimeSync` was removed in Phase 6.1, cross-device sync via Supabase Realtime went with it. The v2 schema never had a publication.
- Design: pick the 3–5 high-change tables (`score`, `tag_score`, `rubric_score`, `observation`, `observation_student`) and publish only them. Client subscribes scoped to `teacher_id = auth.uid()` via RLS.
- Re-enables phone → laptop push updates without round-tripping `get_gradebook`.

### P2.2 · Bulk read RPCs for out-of-gradebook entities

- [ ] `get_gradebook(p_course_id)` covers the active-course surface, but student-profile / goals / reflections / overrides / term-ratings currently require one `get_student_profile` call per student when rendering roster-wide views (e.g. the Reports tab).
- Proposed: `get_course_student_records(p_course_id)` returning the composite bulk payload. One RPC per course swap instead of N per roster paint.
- Sizing: 30-student class × ~6kB each ≈ 180kB per call — still well under PostgREST payload limits.

### P2.3 · `delete_course` semantics decision

- [ ] Currently `delete_course(p_id)` exists on gradebook-prod but has no client call site. ERD says `ON DELETE CASCADE` across course-owned tables — a click would wipe every enrollment, assessment, and score irrecoverably.
- Decide: (a) keep as-is, gated behind a strong confirm; (b) soft-delete via `deleted_at` + a 30-day grace window parallel to teacher soft-delete (Q29); (c) remove the RPC entirely and require archive-only.
- User input required before wiring any UI affordance.

### P2.4 · Regenerate `write-paths.sql` and `read-paths.sql` from live DB

- [ ] 17 live-only RPCs drifted during Phases 4.9 + 5.x (see HANDOFF Discovered gaps 2026-04-20 Phase 2.2 diff). Live database is correct; only the design-artifact mirrors are behind.
- Low-urgency cosmetic fix; blocks no functional work.

## P3 — UI polish / copy

### P3.1 · Freeze `Date.now` in the mobile-components test suite

- [x] *Shipped 2026-04-20 via commit `145686d`* — wrapped the `dateGroupLabel` describe blocks and the multi-group `renders multiple date groups correctly` test with `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.setSystemTime(new Date('2026-04-20T12:00:00Z'))` + `vi.useRealTimers()` in afterEach / finally. Full suite now 805/805 green (previously 800 + 5 flakes). Root cause was `dateGroupLabel` parsing YYYY-MM-DD as local midnight while fixtures computed today via UTC `.toISOString()`.

### P3.2 · Regenerate `docs/backend-design/decisions.html`

- [ ] Q50 (save_course_score hotfix rationale) and Q51 (`--no-ff` merge strategy) were added to `DECISIONS.md` during Phase 5 but the HTML mirror was not regenerated.
- Whatever tool produced the existing HTML (or a re-render from markdown via pandoc/marp) should be run once to sync.

### P3.3 · Replay the `spec-vs-ui-diff.md` audit

- [ ] The Phase 3 verification added ~111 new unit tests but didn't re-read `spec-vs-ui-diff.md` against the actual post-merge UI. Entries in the "historical" status column may now be "matches" or "fixed."
- Light-touch pass — rerun any grep-based checks the original audit used and update per-row status.

### P3.4 · Fix Playwright e2e webServer to serve the built `dist/` with credentials injected

- [x] *Shipped 2026-04-20 via commit TBD.* Added `scripts/build-e2e.sh` (wraps `build.sh`, then sed-substitutes `__SUPABASE_URL__` / `__SUPABASE_KEY__` with syntactically-valid dummies) + `npm run build:e2e` script. Updated `playwright.config.js` webServer command to `npm run build:e2e && npx serve dist -l 8347` with 60s timeout. Result: went from 0 passing → **123 passing / 18 failing / 1 skipped** out of 142. The remaining 18 are content-mismatch (not infrastructure) and tracked under P3.5.

### P3.5 · Reconcile 18 remaining e2e failures against post-merge UI

- [ ] After P3.4 unblocked the e2e infra, these specs still fail:
  - `gradebook.spec.js` × 4 — filter button, Scores/Summary tab rendering, tab-switching
  - `mobile.spec.js` × 11 — sidebar toggle, dashboard content rendering, heatmap, grid layouts, edge cases at 320/375px
  - `reports.spec.js` × 3 — preset buttons, block toggles, print button
- None of these are infrastructure — the pages load, auth is mocked, data is seeded. The tests reference UI affordances that have either moved, renamed, or regressed during the v2 rebuild. A focused session per spec (~15 min each) should resolve most.
- Priority order: gradebook (highest use), then reports, then mobile.

## P4 — demo / seed content

### P4.1 · Promote `_categories_preview` into `import_json_restore`

- [ ] `shared/demo-seed.js` generates a `_categories_preview` array of 3 Q43-spec categories, but `import_json_restore` doesn't currently consume a `categories` section — the preview is informational only.
- Add a `categories` section handler to `import_json_restore` (FK-safe: must come before `assessments` since `assessment.category_id → category.id`), then rename `_categories_preview` → `categories` in `demo-seed.js`.
- Unlocks the demo-seed category weighting flow per the Q43 spec.

### P4.2 · Migrate Demo Mode to consume `buildDemoSeedPayload`

- [ ] Demo Mode currently loads `shared/seed-data.js` (the legacy Science-8 seed). The new `shared/demo-seed.js` Grade-8 Humanities generator (Phase 5.1) is only used for Welcome Class seeding via `applyDemoSeed`.
- Per Q47 follow-up: write a local-only projector that maps the `buildDemoSeedPayload` output into the in-memory cache structure Demo Mode expects, so both Demo Mode and Welcome Class share one source of truth.

## Done / archived

- 2026-04-20 — database-wiring reconciliation plan shipped (`../shipped/2026-04-20-database-wiring-reconciliation.md`).

> **Conventions** — same as the reconciliation plan: commits stay local until user lifts the push embargo, no AI co-author, Demo-Mode verification on UI changes, one task per session, every tick appends a line to `docs/backend-design/HANDOFF.md`'s activity log.
