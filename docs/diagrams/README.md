# FullVision Diagram Reference Assets

Open any `.drawio` file in:
- [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) (web, free)
- draw.io Desktop
- VS Code with the **Draw.io Integration** extension

These files are preserved reference material from the reconciliation, debugging, and user-flow mapping passes. They are useful background, but they are **not** part of the active documentation path.

For current architecture and live execution state, read:

1. [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. [`docs/backend-design/HANDOFF.md`](../backend-design/HANDOFF.md)
3. [`codex.md`](../../codex.md)

## System and runtime diagrams

| # | File | Reference use |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | [system-architecture.drawio](01-system-architecture.drawio) | Historical high-level app and deployment snapshot. |
| 02 | [database-schema.drawio](02-database-schema.drawio) | Visual companion to the backend design SQL/reference docs. |
| 03 | [frontend-module-map.drawio](03-frontend-module-map.drawio) | Shared, desktop, and mobile module relationships. |
| 04 | [auth-and-routing.drawio](04-auth-and-routing.drawio) | Sign-in, auth checks, and route/landing behavior. |
| 05 | [hydration-on-login.drawio](05-hydration-on-login.drawio) | Login/bootstrap hydration flow as diagrammed during reconciliation. |
| 06 | [write-path-map.drawio](06-write-path-map.drawio) | Write-surface map captured during the v2 wiring pass. |
| 07 | [score-entry-paths.drawio](07-score-entry-paths.drawio) | Score-entry interaction/reference map. |
| 08 | [observation-lifecycle.drawio](08-observation-lifecycle.drawio) | Observation capture and report-use reference. |
| 09 | [term-report-flow.drawio](09-term-report-flow.drawio) | Report-generation and term-rating flow reference. |
| 10 | [service-worker-cache.drawio](10-service-worker-cache.drawio) | Service worker and offline/cache behavior snapshot. |

## User-journey source assets

These user-flow files are also reference-only and were produced for diagramming/delivery work rather than as live operating docs:

- [`../lucidchart-user-flows.drawio`](../lucidchart-user-flows.drawio)
- [`../lucidchart-first-time-report-flow.mmd`](../lucidchart-first-time-report-flow.mmd)
- [`../lucidchart-teacher-assignment-comment-grade-flow.mmd`](../lucidchart-teacher-assignment-comment-grade-flow.mmd)

## Notes

- Some diagrams predate the current RPC naming, category-grading rollout, or other current-state cleanup work.
- Treat the `.drawio` and `.mmd` files as preserved source assets, not as authoritative status documents.
