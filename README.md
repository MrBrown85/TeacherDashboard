# FullVision

A standards-based grading and observation tool for British Columbia teachers. Track student proficiency against BC curriculum competencies, record classroom observations, and generate parent-friendly reports.

Built with vanilla JavaScript and a simple copy build for Netlify deploys. Backed by Supabase for auth and data, deployed on Netlify.

**Live app:** [fullvision.ca](https://fullvision.ca) · [Mobile](https://fullvision.ca/teacher-mobile/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for the dev server and test runner)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier works)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrBrown85/TeacherDashboard.git
cd TeacherDashboard
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

Create a Supabase project in **ca-central-1 (Montreal)** for FOIPPA compliance.

The deployed schema is captured in [`schema.sql`](schema.sql) (auto-generated from `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` — do not edit by hand). This checkout currently includes the generated schema dump, but not a checked-in `supabase/` migrations directory, so bootstrap a fresh project from `schema.sql` or restore the migrations separately before using `supabase db push`.

The schema is multi-namespace (`academics.*`, `assessment.*`, `observation.*`, `reporting.*`, `identity.*`, `projection.*`, `integration.*`) with a public-schema RPC interface. Clients only call public RPCs — direct table access is not exposed via PostgREST.

### 3. Configure credentials

Credentials are injected at serve time by [`netlify/edge-functions/inject-env.js`](netlify/edge-functions/inject-env.js). Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` in Netlify → **Site configuration → Environment variables**. Never commit credentials to source.

For local dev without Supabase, use **Demo Mode** (see below) — no credentials needed.

### 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens on port 8347. The root redirects to [`/login.html`](http://localhost:8347/login.html). Click **"Try Demo Mode"** to skip auth and load the Science 8 sample class — handy for UI work without a live Supabase backend.

E2E tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e          # headless
npm run test:e2e:headed   # see the browser
```

```

### Architecture

- **Routing**: Hash-based router in [`teacher/router.js`](teacher/router.js) swaps page modules without full reloads
- **Data layer**: [`shared/data.js`](shared/data.js) — cache-through pattern; synchronous reads from an in-memory `_cache` backed by localStorage. Writes update the cache, persist to localStorage, and fire-and-forget canonical Supabase RPCs in the background. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.
- **Database**: Multi-namespace canonical schema (`academics.*`, `assessment.*`, `observation.*`, `reporting.*`, `identity.*`, `projection.*`, `integration.*`) with a public-schema RPC interface. Every RPC is `SECURITY DEFINER` with `auth.uid()` checks — clients can't bypass authorization via direct table access.
- **Demo mode**: `localStorage.gb-demo-mode='1'` short-circuits Supabase; the Science 8 sample class is auto-seeded by [`shared/seed-data.js`](shared/seed-data.js).
- **Calculation engine**: [`shared/calc.js`](shared/calc.js) — four proficiency methods (mostRecent / highest / mode / decayingAvg) with memoization.
- **Mobile shell**: [`teacher-mobile/shell.js`](teacher-mobile/shell.js) — boot, tab switching, pull-to-refresh, all event delegation via `data-action` attributes.

## Testing

```bash
npm test               # Run full suite
npm run test:watch     # Watch mode
```

657 tests covering the calculation engine, data layer, and mobile UI components.

## Deployment

Push to `main` — Netlify deploys automatically. `bash scripts/build.sh` copies the static site into `dist/`, Netlify publishes `dist/`, and the edge function injects Supabase credentials into HTML responses at request time.
