# Real-Supabase end-to-end tests

These tests exercise the production write path against the live `gradebook-prod` Supabase project. Unlike `e2e/` (which mocks auth and seeds via `localStorage`), these tests sign in as a real user, hit real RPCs, and assert state by querying tables directly.

They exist because the mocked tests cannot detect data-loss bugs that live in the auth + RPC layer.

## Layout

```
e2e-real/
├── helpers/         shared auth, course, db, ui, fixture helpers
├── persistence/     per-entity specs (5-test matrix each, 80 tests across 16 entities)
└── smoke/           full-class smoke (1 test, builds an entire class and round-trips it)
```

## Test surfaces

- **Per-entity specs** (`persistence/`) — every entity that the UI writes has its own spec covering create, edit, delete, race-immediate-signOut, and value round-trip. Drives the production write helper, not the RPC directly. Coverage: students, categories, curriculum, assignments, grades, observations, rubrics, modules, notes, goals, reflections, term-ratings, tag-scores, custom-tags, course-config, section-overrides.
- **Smoke spec** (`smoke/full-class.spec.js`) — one comprehensive test that builds a complete class through the same UI helpers a real teacher uses (wizard + roster + scoring + observations + notes + goals + …), recycles the session, and asserts every entity round-trips. Tagged `@smoke`.

## Required setup

These tests are skipped automatically when env vars are missing. To run them locally you need:

1. **A disposable test account in `gradebook-prod`.** Sign up at https://fullvision.ca/login.html with an email like `fv-tests+1@example.com`. This account will accumulate test courses (the suite archives them at the start of each run, but they aren't hard-deleted).

2. **A `.env` at repo root** with the following (gitignored — do not commit):

   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://novsfeqjhbleyyaztmlh.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_KEY=sb_publishable_FfgtpNV7PStzUvYVD7qWOg_aAVjGrTY
   TEST_USER_EMAIL=fv-tests+1@example.com
   TEST_USER_PASSWORD=<the-password-you-set>
   ```

   `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` are also used by `npm run dev:local`. The publishable key shown is the production `prod202604` key; the legacy anon key works too.

3. **Playwright browsers installed.** If you've already run `npm test:e2e` once they are. Otherwise: `npx playwright install chromium`.

## Running

```bash
# Full suite — every persistence spec + the smoke spec (~7–10 minutes serial)
npm run test:e2e:real

# Smoke only — fastest pre-merge confidence check (~90s)
npm run test:e2e:real:smoke

# Race tests only — when debugging queue / sign-out timing
npm run test:e2e:real:race

# Watch the browser during a run
npm run test:e2e:real:headed

# Target one test by name
npx playwright test --config=playwright.real.config.js -g "value round-trip"
```

### When to run what

- **Smoke** — before merging any PR that touches `shared/data.js`, `shared/supabase.js`, `shared/offline-queue.js`, or auth lifecycle. CI runs this automatically on persistence-touching paths.
- **Full suite** — before merging a structural change (new RPC, new write path, new entity); locally only — the suite is too slow to gate every PR.
- **Race only** — when chasing a specific sign-out / queue regression; tag is on every spec's race-immediate-signOut test.

## What these tests don't do

- **They don't reset the test account between runs.** Courses get archived (not deleted), so the auth.users row + accumulated archived courses persist. If the test user account drifts into a weird state, sign in via the UI and clean up manually.
- **They don't run in CI without further work.** CI would need the `TEST_USER_*` and `SUPABASE_*` secrets configured. Until then, run locally before merging anything that touches the persistence layer.
- **They run serially (one worker).** The tests share a test user and would race on cleanup if parallelized.
